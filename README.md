I'm Jules Guillot, a French researcher in applied maths, working on data assimilation.
My researches focus on uncertainty quantification for data assimilation, treating the model and observation errors trough ensemble methods such as the EnKF and the particle filter.
The following repositories correspond to some algorithms detailed in my PhD manuscript with the related numerical experiments.
